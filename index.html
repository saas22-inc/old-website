        <h1>A Note from the Founder</h1>

        <p>We started this journey in 2024, when it became clear that distribution in tech was breaking.</p>

        <p>Inbound marketing was losing effectiveness as buyers began discovering products through LLMs, not blogs. Outbound got saturated with spray-and-pray messaging. SaaS became easier to build but harder to differentiate -- while AI blurred trust across digital and real-world interactions.</p>

        <p>Instead of rushing to build yet another product struggling to crack distribution, we chose a different path -- to help solve distribution itself.</p>

        <p>Over the last two years, we've worked with 15+ SaaS and AI companies across geographies and verticals. We launched partner programs, built co-sell motions, onboarded hundreds of partners, and ran curated events across continents -- operating deep at the intersection of AI, partnerships, and GTM.</p>

        <p>A few things became clear:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Traditional inbound and outbound GTM models are losing steam</li>
            <li>Partnerships fail not because of intent, but because of execution</li>
            <li>Software alone isn't enough -- outcomes matter</li>
            <li>Contextual AI can fundamentally reshape partner ecosystems</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>A New Name</strong><br>
        SaaS22 reflected where we started -- during a moment when SaaS itself was being reshaped. But our work has since expanded well beyond a single category.</p>

        <p>JazzHQ is the productization of our learnings in the last two years.<br>
        We're now building infrastructure for partner-led distribution and ecosystems across SaaS, AI, and traditionally channel-first industries.<br>
        JazzHQ better represents this evolution.</p>

        <p>JazzHQ is an AI-powered Partner Operating System, backed by forward-deployed teams and a curated marketplace -- built to help companies scale through partners, predictably and globally.</p>

        <p>The name reflects how we think about growth today: not as a rigid, linear motion, but as an orchestrated system -- where partners, products, and GTM motions come together in rhythm. It also signals our ambition to be the control center for partner-led growth, not just another point solution.</p>

        <p>We remain rooted in SaaS and AI, while actively foraging into a broader spectrum of partner-first industries -- including IT services, manufacturing, real estate, telcos, fintech, and beyond.</p>

        <p>We're evolving, but we'll always prioritize outcomes over software.</p>

        <p>We're still learning -- yet we're convinced of one thing:</p>
        
        <p><em>with all else equal, distribution is the only moat, and partnerships are how modern companies win.</em></p>
